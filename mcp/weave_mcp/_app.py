INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Weave is a project-management app with 5 sub-apps: Branch (PM/tasks), Canvas (docs),
Track (cross-branch workflows), Schedule (calendar), and Scrum (weekly boards). These
tools drive it over Weave's REST API, acting as the token's owner.

Getting oriented:
- get_current_user() resolves "me"/"my" (the account the token acts as).
- Most tools need a branch_id. Pass either the numeric id OR the branch key of a branch
  you're a member of (e.g. branch_id="WV") — the key is resolved automatically. Use
  list_branches() to discover those branches. (Exception: to join a public branch you're
  not in yet, pass join_branch a numeric id from list_public_branches.) Likewise
  list_canvases(), list_tracks(), and list_scrum_boards() are the entry points for those apps.
- To find something when you don't have its id, use search_tasks / search_docs /
  search_issues instead of listing every branch.

Before creating or updating tasks:
- status and task_type accept the branch's key (case-insensitive) or display label;
  omit them on create to use the branch's defaults. Invalid values fail with the
  valid set in the error (valid_statuses / valid_task_types), so a pre-check via
  list_workflow_statuses(branch_id) / list_task_types(branch_id) is only needed
  for exploration.
- assignee and participant params (assignee_main/assignee_sub, add/remove_task_assignee
  user_id, participant_ids) accept a user id, an exact username, an email, or "me" —
  resolved against the branch's member list (ambiguous matches fail with candidates;
  digit-only strings are treated as ids). Other user_id params (member management etc.)
  still take numeric ids from list_branch_members(branch_id).

Conventions: ids are integers and dates are ISO YYYY-MM-DD. Every tool returns the
API's JSON on success, or {"error": {...}} on failure — a nested object with
"category" (one of auth, forbidden, not_found, validation, conflict, rate_limited,
network, server, business), "code" (the canonical error code, may be null), "message",
"http_status", "retryable" (true only for network/server/rate_limited), and optional
"retry_after"/"detail". Treat any top-level "error" key as failure, never success — a
successful result never carries a top-level "error" field. category="auth" means the
token is dead — stop and surface it; "forbidden" means the token is fine but the action
isn't allowed."""
